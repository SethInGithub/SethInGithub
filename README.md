## My Coding Journey 🌱
I started coding in middle school, learning HTML. From building simple web pages, I ventured into JavaScript, making interactive sites. The excitement of creating something from nothing drove my passion of coding. But as I dove deeper, I discovered Python and fell in love with its simplicity and power, I made an [AI assistant](https://github.com/SethInGithub/AI-Assistant), and many other projects.

But when I got into high school and I saw there was a coding class, I knew I needed to be in it. I joined and found out it used Java. Great.
